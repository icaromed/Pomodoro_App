# Pomodoro_App
An app that checks if it is a good time (for each user) to do an activity using the time management method "Pomodoro Techinique". Then there is the possibility of running a pomodoro timer (costumized by the user or using default definitions).

## How it works step-by-step:
The app, by inputs/questions , gets the avaiable time of the user than checks if "now" is a good time for using the pomodoro clock (Did he say that he was intended to be sleeping by now or not?). If not, the app asks if the user wants to start a pomo "right now". If so, the user can costumize (or not) the configuration of his pomodoro timer and run the timer on the app itself.
